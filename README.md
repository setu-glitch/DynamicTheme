# Dynamic Theme
Dynamic Theme with K-Means Clustering is a web application that transforms a photo into a color palette that can be used to dynamically change the theme of a website or application. The application uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to analyze the colors in a photo and extract the most dominant colors, which are then used to generate a color palette.
